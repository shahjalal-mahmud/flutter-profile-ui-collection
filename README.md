> **Module 2 · Class 2 Assignment**
> National Android Development Bootcamp by **BDApps & Ostad**

A pixel-perfect Flutter UI clone of the **Instagram profile screen** built as a frontend-only assignment project.
The goal is to practice responsive layouts, reusable widget architecture, Material 3 theming, and modern mobile UI design principles — with full **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode** support.

---

## 📱 Project Overview

This assignment replicates the real Instagram profile screen of **@shahjalal_mahmud**, matching every detail:
top app bar, profile stats, bio, story highlights, posts grid, tab bar, and bottom navigation — all in Flutter, with no backend or authentication.

The focus is entirely on:

✅ Pixel-perfect UI replication
✅ Clean, reusable widget architecture
✅ Light Mode & Dark Mode theming
✅ Responsive & scrollable layout
✅ Modern Flutter best practices

- Instagram-accurate color tokens for both themes

---

## 🧩 Flutter Concepts Used

- Stateless & Stateful Widgets
- `CustomScrollView` with Slivers (`SliverAppBar`, `SliverGrid`, `SliverToBoxAdapter`)
- `Column`, `Row`, `Stack`, `Positioned`
- `ListView` (horizontal highlights scroll)
- `ClipOval` for circular images
- `Material 3` with custom `ThemeData`
- `ColorScheme` for light/dark theming
- `MediaQuery` & `SafeArea` for responsiveness
- `const` constructors throughout for performance
- Asset management (`pubspec.yaml` configuration)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

- Flutter SDK (3.x or above)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio or VS Code
- Android Emulator or Physical Device

---

### 🔧 Installation

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahjalal-mahmud/flutter-profile-ui-collection.git
cd flutter-profile-ui-collection
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
flutter pub get
```

**3. Add your photos** *(optional — placeholder images are already included)*

Replace the images in `assets/images/` with your own:

| File                        | Purpose                               |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `profile.jpg`               | Profile picture (header + bottom nav) |
| `highlight_itsme.jpg`       | "It's me 🙂" highlight cover          |
| `highlight_dark.jpg`        | "Dark 🖤" highlight cover             |
| `post_1.jpg` → `post_9.jpg` | Posts grid images                     |

**4. Run the app**

```bash
flutter run
```

---

### 🌗 Switching Theme Mode

The app follows system appearance by default. To force a theme during development, edit `main.dart`:

```dart
themeMode: ThemeMode.dark,    // Force dark mode
themeMode: ThemeMode.light,   // Force light mode
themeMode: ThemeMode.system,  // Follow device setting (default)
```

| Technology               | Usage                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Flutter 3.x              | UI Development          |
| Dart 3.x                 | Programming Language    |
| Material Design 3        | UI Components & Theming |
| Android Studio / VS Code | Development Environment |

> ⚡ Zero third-party packages — built entirely with Flutter's built-in widgets.

---

## ✅ Code Quality Highlights

- `const` constructors used everywhere for rebuild performance
- No magic numbers — all sizes/colors/strings live in `core/constants/`
- `SliverGrid` + `SliverAppBar` for smooth, jank-free unified scrolling
- `errorBuilder` fallback on every `Image.asset` call — app never crashes on missing assets
- Theme-aware colors via `Theme.of(context).brightness` throughout
- Clean separation: models → widgets → screen — nothing dumped into `main.dart`

---

## 🎯 Assignment Objective

The main objective of this assignment is to:

- Practice Flutter UI development
- Understand widget tree structure and layout building
- Learn responsive mobile design principles
- Build and organize reusable widget components
- Replicate real-world application interfaces accurately

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this assignment I practiced and improved my understanding of:

- Flutter's Sliver-based scroll system (`CustomScrollView`, `SliverGrid`, `SliverAppBar`)
- Building clean architecture without overengineering
- Material 3 `ThemeData` and `ColorScheme` for proper dark/light support
- Separating concerns: constants · models · widgets · screens
- Handling responsive layouts with `SafeArea` and `MediaQuery`
- Managing complex nested widgets while keeping code readable

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

Although this assignment only requires frontend UI, future enhancements may include:

- Navigation between multiple profile screens (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub)
- Animated story highlight ring
- Smooth page transitions
- Firebase Authentication & real user data
- Dynamic post loading from an API
